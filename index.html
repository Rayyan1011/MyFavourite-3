  <p>Crash Bandicoot is a video game franchise, originally developed by Naughty Dog as an exclusive for Sony's PlayStation console and has seen numerous installments created by numerous developers and published on multiple platforms. The series consists predominantly of platform games, but also includes spin-offs in the kart racing and party game genres.</p>
  <p>Crash began life as a simple, normal bandicoot, living freely as a wild animal in the jungles of N. Sanity island. He was captured by Doctor Neo Cortex, in order to be made the general of Cortex's Cortex Commandos, as part of his evil plan to conquer the world. He was mutated by Cortex and his right-hand-man, Doctor Nitrus Brio, with the Evolvo-Ray, which gave him human sapience and made him anthropomorphic. Despite Brio's warnings of the machine's unreliability, Cortex then sent Crash through the Cortex Vortex, a machine designed to make Crash into a genius and brainwash him into becoming 100% loyal to Cortex's every order. The machine failed just as Brio predicted and malfunctioned, rejecting Crash. This allowed Crash to escape and run loose within the lab. Cortex gave chase after Crash trying to recapture him, only for Crash to run out a window, falling into the sea below.</p>
